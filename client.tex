The script contains a single infinite loop that waits for user input events and performs different actions based on the type of event. The main functions of the script are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{pygame.init()}: This function initializes the Pygame library. It must be called before any other Pygame functions can be used.
    \item \textbf{pygame.display.set\_mode((100, 100), pygame.RESIZABLE)}: This function creates a Pygame window with the dimensions 100x100 pixels and sets it to be resizable. The window is stored in the variable \textit{SCREEN}.
    \item \textbf{SCREEN.fill("1B1D1E")}: This function fills the window with the color "1B1D1E".
    \item \textbf{socket.gethostbyname("autole")}: This function attempts to get the host IP of a server named "autole". If the server cannot be found, an exception is raised.
    \item \textbf{input("Unable to locate server!\\nPlease input ip manually:\\n")}: This function prompts the user to manually input the IP of the server.
    \item \textbf{direction = None}: This variable is used to store the direction of movement (None, "up", or "down") when the up or down arrow key is pressed.
    \item \textbf{pygame.event.get()}: This function returns a list of all events that have occurred since the last time it was called.
\end{itemize}
